title: "I work remotely"

I have been working in the tech domain over the last twenty years (OMG!). Over that period of time, I've transitioned from 
working in an office 100% of my time to be fully remote. This is my personal experience so far, lessons learnt and 
things I'm still struggling with.

**Note**: If you're interested in going deeper on the benefits of Remote work, I recommend the book 
[REMOTE, office not required](https://basecamp.com/books/remote), by [@jasonfried](https://twitter.com/jasonfried) 
and [@dhh](https://twitter.com/dhh).

## Avoid commuting to work

Living in Barcelona, if you work for a company which local office inside the city, normally commuting would be
no longer than 40 minutes, and that was my case (40 minutes max one way). Over the years I used the usual means of transport:

* **metro**: a bit crowded in the mornings, fine in the afternoons. Very uncomfortable in summer time, when the humidity
    in Barcelona is very high. Good option for allocating some time to read.

* **public bicycle system**: it works fine, even though it's fairly common that you need to visit a couple of stations
    for getting your bicycle or finding a free slot to return it. Things are getting better over time though.

* **my own bicycle**: my favorite option. I had a 25 minutes ride for getting to the office, good enough for doing
    some physical exercise without sweating. We're getting a pretty good bicycle lines map here.

* **bike**: fastest option, but that's the only advantage compared with the others, and it's for sure the most dangerous one.

In the best case (bike), it would take me around 50 minutes (two ways) every day. Now that I'm working from home, I earned
that time, for free. 5 days a week during 11 months over the year means roughly 183 hours per year, equivalent to around 22 days work
(a month!), 5000 km with my road bicycle or around 2000 km running. **Every year**.

I've never been a fun of commuting so I'm taking this as a great improvement in my daily routine.

## Get your working space right

Over the last years I've been testing different options at my place to find the right environment to work. We moved in our current
apartment a couple of years ago, and only in the last few months I've felt I found the room, furniture, lighting and hardware that
works for me. I tried several options before, but they were either too noisy, bright, dark or distracting.

Before my current job I worked sporadically from home, and back then it was not that relevant for me to have a dedicated space.
But now that I work from home 100% of my time, it's key to separate my professional and personal environment, and make sure I'm
productive and focus while working.

## Hardware

Having different laptops/computers for my professional and personal topics has never been a priority for me, neither it's today.
But in the last year I left my MacBook Pro 2017 as secondary device and acquired a PC. Not that I was planning to switched from macOS
to Windows/Linux, but the perceived performance of this laptop was extremelly low for me. I got some suggestions from
[Arturo](https://twitter.com/arturogdg) about hardware and some help from [Iván](https://twitter.com/drslump) for setting up a Hackintosh.
This is the hardware that I acquired and overall I'm very happy with the outcome. Performance is much better and I've never got
infuriated due to my computer under performing:

* **CPU:**: Intel Core i7-8700K 3.7Ghz BOX.
* **Motherboard:**: Gigabyte Z390 Aorus Pro.
* **Memory**: Corsair Vengeance LPX DDR4 3200 PC4-25600 32GB.
* **SSD**: Samsung 860 EVO Basic SSD 500GB SATA3.
* **Power supply**: Corsair RM750X V2 750W 80 Plus Gold Modular.
* **Screen**: LG 34UC99-W.
* **Tower case**: NZXT H500i.
* **Webcam**: Logitech C930e.

## Social time

I used to spend a lot of time hanging out with my coworkers when I was working for Telefónica. The company itself (Telefónica R&D) was around
1000 employees back then, and over the ten years I worked there I had the chance to meet a lot of great people.
In my last role in the company I was leading a 30 members team in an organization of around 150, which meant a lot of interactions, both
professional and personal ones. When I left the company almost three years ago, I thought the social part was going to be one the
things I'd miss the most, and looking back that's been the case.
It was very common to hang out in a coffee break, lunch time or after work with a beer, and I do miss that!
Nevertheless I've done several activities I would not have done if I continued working there, like joining a triathlon club (even though
I don't swim, that's an opportunity to hang out with runners and riders :-)), attending a japanese food course or taking some painting
classes.

## Family time

It's not something that I knew it would happen when I started working remotely, but my daugther was born one month ago, one of the best things ever happened to me.
After some weeks of parental leave, I've got back to work. Knowing that I'm 30 seconds away from her 


## Avoid interruptions
Working in an office usually means you'd get tons of interruptions during a day, specially if you're working in an open space.
Working from home does not mean you won't have any interruptions, but you can probably impact on those interruptions and get rid of them.

## Flexible working hours, but limit them

Working from home means it's much simpler to change my working hours, and having that flexibility is great for those days
when something requires my attention, or just it's 12PM, it's sunny and I'm willing to run for a while.

I've been using several daily schedules, and the one that currently works better for me is:

- start working early in the morning (7 AM): that's a requirement because our company is not only fully remote but also fully distributed. We have people
 in San Francisco, Sydney, Perth and Barcelona. While most of our work is asynchronous, having a daily standup helps us to sync up and hang out a bit.
- take a long break at noon: something like 3-4 hours, so I can spend some time with the family, do my almost daily run while training the next marathon and
 even take a short nap. 
- work another 4-5 hours in the afternoon: this is important for having some overlap hours with PST timezone.

Unfortunately that's the theory, in practice it's very common for me to work very long hours, but I'm working to improve it :blush:. 

## Technology / Tools
Those are the tools we're using for our day 2 day work:

- [Jamm](https://jamm.app) (**disclaimer**: that's the product we're building): for any audio-visual synchronous / asynchronous communication, both 1:1 and group based. You
can request access to our private beta [here](https://jammhq.typeform.com/to/m0mbZw).
- [Slack](https://slack.com/): for internal communication we don't use email, hence we're using Slack for any text-based communication. We also use Slack as an information hub
(integrations with our cloud provider, Typeform, source code, ticketing tool, etc)
- [Notion](https://notion.so): internal documentation.
