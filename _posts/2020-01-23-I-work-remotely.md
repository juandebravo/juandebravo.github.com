title: "I work remotely"

I have been working in the tech domain over the last twenty years. I've transitioned
over that period of time from working 100% of my time in an office to be fully remote. This is my experience so far,
lessons learnt and things I'm still struggling with.

## Avoid commuting to work

I live in Barcelona and the previous companies I worked had their local office inside the city, which makes commuting
no longer than 40 minutes. Over the years I used the usual means of transport:

* **metro**: a bit crowded in the mornings, fine in the afternoons. Very uncomfortable in summer time, when the humidity
    in Barcelona is very high. Good option for allocating some time to read.

* **public bicycle system**: it works fine, even though it's not uncommon that you need to visit a couple of stations
    for getting your bicycle, or a couple of them for finding a free slot. Things are getting better over time.

* **my own bicycle**: my favorite option. I had a 25 minutes ride for getting to the office, good enough for doing
    some physical exercise without sweating. We're getting a pretty good bicycle lines map here.

* **bike**: fastest option, but that's the only advantage compared with the others, and it's for sure the most dangerous one.

In the best case (bike), it would take me around 50 minutes (two ways) every day. Now that I'm working from home, I earned
that time, for free. 5 days a week during 11 months over the year means roughly 183 hours per year, equivalent to around 22 days work
(a month!), 5000 km with my road bicycle or around 2000 km running. **Every year**.

I've never been a fun of commuting so I'm taking this as a great improvement in my daily routine.

## Get your working space right

Over the last years I've been testing different options at my place to find the right environment to work. We moved in our current
apartment a couple of years ago, and only in the last few months I've felt I found the room, furniture, lighting and hardware that
works for me. I tried several options before, but they were either too noisy, bright, dark or distracting.

Before my current job I worked sporadically from home, and back then it was not that relevant for me to have a dedicated space.
But now that I work from home 95% of my time, it's key to separate my professional and personal environment, and make sure I'm
productive and focus while working.

## Hardware

Having different laptops/computers for my professional and personal topics has never been a requirement for me, neither it's today.
But in the last year I left my MacBook Pro 2017 as secondary device and acquired a PC. Not that I was planning to switched from macOS
to Windows/Linux, but the perceived performance of this laptop was extremelly low for me. I got some suggestions from
[Arturo](https://twitter.com/arturogdg) about hardware and some help from [Iván](https://twitter.com/drslump) for setting up a Hackintosh.
This is the hardware that I acquired and overall I'm very happy with the switch. Performance is way bigger and I've never got
infuriated due to my computer under performing:

* **CPU:**: Intel Core i7-8700K 3.7Ghz BOX.
* **Motherboard:**: Gigabyte Z390 Aorus Pro.
* **Memory**: Corsair Vengeance LPX DDR4 3200 PC4-25600 32GB.
* **SSD**: Samsung 860 EVO Basic SSD 500GB SATA3.
* **Power supply**: Corsair RM750X V2 750W 80 Plus Gold Modular.
* **Screen**: LG 34UC99-W.
* **Tower case**: NZXT H500i.
* **Webcam**: Logitech C930e.

## Social time

I used to spend a lot of time hanging out with my coworkers when I was working for Telefónica. The company itself (Telefónica R&D) was around
1000 employees back then, and over the ten years I worked there I had the chance to meet a lot of great people.
In my last role in the company I was leading a 30 members team in an organization of around 150, which meant a lot of interactions, both
professional and personally. When I left the company almost three years ago, I thought the social part was going to be one the
things I'd miss the most, and looking back that's been the case.
It was very common to hang out in a coffee break, lunch time or after work with a beer, and I do miss that!
Nevertheless I've done several activities I would not have done if I continued working there, like joining a triathlon club (even though
I don't swim, that's an opportunity to hang out with runners and riders :-)), attending a japanese food course or taking some painting
classes.

## Family time

It's not something that was known when I started working remotely, but my daugther was born one month ago


## Communication and collaboration with your team
