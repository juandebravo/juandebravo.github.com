**Por quién doblas las campanas**

Some years ago a colleague of mine was so stressed and
focus on a forthcoming delivery of the project he was
leadings that when his grandmother passed away he didn't
attend her funeral. It was a socking experience for me
and I promised to myself it would never happen to me. Not
only that, I realized I didn't want to feel when the
moment come that I hadn't spent enough time with them
during their last days/months of life.

When I was a child I spent a lot of time with my grandpa,
as they were usually the first *backup* option when my parents
needed someone to attend their kids, not only on vacations
but mainly in the day2day *small things*.

I went to University in Valladolid to study Telecom Engineer.
The last thing I needed to acomplish to become a graduate was
a final project, that I entitled `Título proyecto fin de carrera`.
It was a tradition to dedicate your work to all the people in your
life that had a relevance in that time, family, friends, colleagues.
I decided to dedicate my final project twice, the former to all
that people relevant to me, the later to my grandparents, **Dedicado
a mis abuelos**. It was a simple way to give them back a bit of
all those things they made for me when I was a baby.

[My grandparent](http://es.wikipedia.com/Francisco_Bravo) passed away
three years ago. He was getting aged so it was not a surprise,
which does not mean those were sad days. My grandpa was for me
a model of what I'd like myself to be, a quiet and humbled person,
a natural and respectful leader, and someone putting his family as
the major priority on top of anything else.

My grandma had no real reason to live after that time, and her last
months had been a continuous and slow *deterioro* in her healthiness.
Eventually she passed away last Friday.

I'm really happy I managed to spend some quality time with them everytime
I visited my home city in the last years. And this is what this post is
about, a simple reminder that we must ensure we're giving the right
priority to those things that are most important for us, so we'll
never *arrepentirse*.

Bye bye grandpas... if we could meet `solo una vez`...
