Healthy employees will be more productive on the job. Unhappy employees take more sick days. Studies have determinied that happiness functions as the cause, not just the result, of good health.

Companies and leaders who take measures to cultivate a happy workplace will not only have more productive and efficient workers, they will have less absenteeism and lower healthcare expenditures.

Positive emotions fllod out brains with dopamine and serotonin, chemicals that not only make us feel good, but dial up the learning centers of our brains to higher levels. They help us organize new information, keep that information in the brain longer, and retrieve it faster later on. Positive emotions actually expand our peripheral line of vision.

Smart companies cultivate these kinds of working environments because every time employees exprience a small bursts of happiness, they get primed for creativity and innovation. They see solutions they might otherwise have missed.
